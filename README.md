2D arena fighter solo project

This is a solo project I started in the summer of between my 3rd and 4th years at university. I wanted to create a small arena fighter experience that can be played locally.

The idea is up to 4 players all with shields and guns. The bullets will bounce perfectly from every surface and shield and players must bounce the shots off surfaces to hit their enemies in the back. There will be powerups and new weapons around the arena that spawn and give players an advantage. Currently there is only one pickup, and assault rifle that increases rate of fire bullet speed and range. There are currently two local players enabled with access to shooting and a flashbang that disables movement in an area around the explosion.

There are currently some bugs in the current build but I have not been able to work on this since the start of the acedemic year (2017/18).
